# Customer-Segmentation-and-Generating-Random-Dataset-using-K-Means-Clustering-with-Python



## Objectives

After completing this lab you will be able to:

*   Use scikit-learn's K-Means Clustering to cluster data


## Introduction

There are many models for **clustering** out there. In this notebook, we will be presenting the model that is considered one of the simplest models amongst them. Despite its simplicity, the **K-means** is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, it is especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from **unlabeled data**. In this notebook, you will learn how to use k-Means for customer segmentation.

Some real-world applications of k-means:

*   Customer segmentation
*   Understand what the visitors of a website are trying to accomplish
*   Pattern recognition
*   Machine learning
*   Data compression

In this notebook we practice k-means clustering with 2 examples:

*   k-means on a random generated dataset
*   Using k-means for customer segmentation
